## 1. Project Title

AI Crew Dispatch

## 2. Name of Issue/Topic

This is a demo application for Hacktoberfest on their [31-Custom CoPilotKit App(HacktoberfestDemo)](https://github.com/CopilotKit/CopilotKit/issues/644) to address issue #644.  

This app will use AI to match crew members to a dispatch cohort for a pending job.  It will post the proposed dispatch crew to a board for approval from dispatch team, and crew members. This reduces the time it takes for the dispatch team to research their database for information about crew members, schedule availability, and skill match to job requirements before dispatching the crew to the job.  The scope of this demo will be just to prepare the dispatch team for approvals. It will not actually launch the dispatch or include the approval components; That will be another project scope/sprint/user-story.
